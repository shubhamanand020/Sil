## About

Sil is a project written primarily in TypeScript. The repository description currently reads: "will be deleted soon". This README is a general guide to get the project running and to help contributors understand how to work on the codebase.

## Languages

- TypeScript (~97.5%)
- JavaScript (~2%)
- Other (~0.5%)

## Requirements

- Node.js 16+ (or 14+ if you need wider compatibility)
- npm (>=6) or yarn
- Git

Optional:
- Docker (if you prefer containerized runs)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shubhamanand020/Sil.git
cd Sil
```

2. Install dependencies (npm or yarn):

```bash
# using npm
npm install

# or using yarn
yarn install
```

## Build

If the project uses TypeScript's compiler (tsc), build with:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

If there is no build script, you can run tsc directly (requires a tsconfig.json):

```bash
npx tsc --project tsconfig.json
```

## Run / Development

Common development workflows:

- Start a dev server (with hot reload if configured):

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

- Start the compiled app:

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

If the repository is a library, you might link it locally:

```bash
npm link
# or
yarn link
```

## Tests

Look for a test runner (Jest, Mocha, Vitest). Common commands:

```bash
npm test
# or
yarn test

# run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

If there are no test scripts, add tests using your preferred runner (Jest + ts-jest is a common choice for TypeScript).

## Linting & Formatting

If ESLint and Prettier are used, run:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run format
```

Or use the configured npm scripts in package.json.

## Docker

If there is a Dockerfile, build and run with:

```bash
docker build -t sil .
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 sil
```

Adjust the port and commands according to the actual app.

## Project structure (recommended)

This is a common layout for TypeScript projects. The actual repo may vary.

```
project-root/
├─ src/                # TypeScript source files
├─ dist/               # Compiled JS output (gitignored)
├─ test/               # Tests
├─ package.json
├─ tsconfig.json
├─ .eslintrc.js
├─ .prettierrc
└─ README.md
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Suggested workflow:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feat/your-feature`.
3. Make changes and add tests if appropriate.
4. Run linters and tests locally.
